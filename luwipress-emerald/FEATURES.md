# LuwiPress Emerald — Theme Feature Overview

**Version:** 1.6.7 · **License:** GPLv2+ · **Target:** WooCommerce stores using LuwiPress

LuwiPress Emerald is the first **ecosystem-integrated** WordPress theme: built specifically to surface the LuwiPress AI plugin's intelligence on the storefront. Where most themes stop at layout and typography, Gold turns AI Knowledge Graph signals, customer chat, plugin-detection, and live search suggestions into first-class store features the visitor actually feels.

Ships as a **379 KB ZIP** with a 12-screen Elementor Kit, eight custom Elementor widgets, native Customizer panel, branded WooCommerce templates (cart, checkout, my-account, archive, single-product), and a 5-pass slug-conflict resolver — paired with the LuwiPress core plugin (3.1.45+) for full reciprocal awareness.

## 🆕 What's new in 1.6.x

### 1.6.7 — Loader UX overhaul + responsive polish
- **Real page-ready loader** — the page-loader overlay no longer dismisses on a fixed timer. It now waits for the actual readiness signals: window.load fires, web fonts settle, images visible in the initial viewport finish loading, then a small stabilisation tick before fading. The promise the loader makes ("page is ready") is now honoured. A 5-second failsafe in the boot script fires only if the page JavaScript breaks entirely.
- **No more "scrolled into blank space"** — when the loader dismisses, every below-the-fold section is force-revealed at the same instant. Visitors no longer see content fade in mid-scroll as IntersectionObservers catch up.
- **Responsive breadcrumb spacing** — on tablet (≤900 px) and phone (≤600 px), the breadcrumb now sits at a clean 40-56 px below the sticky header instead of touching it. Selectors widened to catch the breadcrumb at any nesting depth (the editorial article wrapper was previously bypassing the rule).

### 1.6.6 — Migration-from-Hello-Elementor template override
- **Posts with the `elementor_header_footer` page template now route through Gold's canvas** instead of Elementor Pro's bare bundled file. Migrated stores no longer end up with single posts that render header + raw content + footer with no `<main>` wrapper, no breadcrumb, no reading-progress hook. Closes the long-running "some posts open, some don't" symptom.

### 1.6.5 — Cache-buster + maintenance-grade polish
- **Theme version is now read dynamically** from `style.css` so a single bump in the Version line propagates to every cache-buster query string. Stores no longer hit "I uploaded the new ZIP but visitors still see the old JS".
- **Mega panel banner** — every mega-menu dropdown now opens with a refined banner head: filled count pill in the brand accent, serif title, "View all →" CTA with currentColor underline animation. Column heads use proper flex layout so counts sit cleanly to the right of category names.
- **Homepage filter pills** — operator-built pill bars (`.tap-pills` HTML widgets sitting above a WC product grid) now wire up to client-side category filtering automatically. No data attributes required on the markup; the theme reads the live category tree, slugifies pill labels, and hides products that don't match the picked branch.
- **Loader safety timer** in the inline boot script (5 s) — guarantees no stuck loader even when the theme JavaScript fails entirely. Pairs with the real-event dismissal in 1.6.7.

### 1.6.4 — WPML/Polylang slug hegemony + commerce flow
- **Cross-language slug-collision discovery** — the redirect resolver now walks WPML's translation table (and Polylang's translation API) so translated page slugs (`/es/percusiones/`, `/fr/vents/`) auto-redirect to the canonical category archive even when the operator kept WooCommerce term slugs in the source language. Closes the gap a literal SQL JOIN couldn't bridge.
- **Render-time URL rewrite in mega menu** — clicking a top-level category in the menu now goes directly to `/product-category/...` even when the operator's stored menu item points at a legacy hub page. No 301 hop, no flash of the old page.
- **Branded empty-cart state** — when the cart is empty, visitors see an editorial fallback (icon + headline + "Browse the collection" CTA + a 3-product best-seller rail) instead of WooCommerce's default text block. Hand-built from the same design tokens as the rest of the store, so it never feels like a third-party widget.
- **Server-side page loader** — the loader overlay is now in the HTML before the first paint (instead of being JS-injected on DOMContentLoaded). No flash-of-content-before-loader on slow product pages with large hero images.
- **Shop-by-category column** in the footer — auto-generated from the top-level WC product categories, with item counts and a "View all collections →" link. Customizer-toggleable; respects the operator's preferred limit (3-12 items).
- **Payment-row brand grouping** — multi-method processors like WooPayments collapse from nine adjacent pills (`Card / Alipay / iDEAL / EPS / …`) to one clean "WooPayments" pill with the methods in a tooltip. Footer reads as a brand list, not a clutter of options.
- **Default trust signals** — on WooCommerce stores with the operator hasn't set custom trust copy, the footer auto-fills "Secure checkout · Worldwide shipping · 30-day returns" so day-one launch never looks bare.

### 1.6.3 — Health pass on top of the 1.6.0 mobile sprint
Hub redirects, slug-collision fuzzy match, smart filter sidebar (replaces the redundant Categories list with WC's native attribute widgets), blog page auto-promotion, Elementor canvas template (root-cause fix for "some old posts won't open"), parent-term archive enrichment, footer enhancements (9 platform SVG social icons + newsletter form + 3 trust signals + auto WC payment row + dedicated Customizer panel), mega menu Customizer panel (threshold + columns + counts + mobile mode + blog auto-inject toggle), archive chip strip default-OFF, "You may also enjoy" duplicate suppression.

### 1.6.0 — Full Mobile Spec Preview v2 implementation
4 new editorial templates (`404.php`, `search.php`, `page-contact.php`, `page-about.php`, `single-master.php`), reading-progress bar on single posts, audio-card play state, sticky checkout bars on cart and checkout, drawer search consolidation (single-search-entry-point UX). 1240-line `@media` layer covering all 13 design sections from the handoff brief. Twelve `apply_filters('luwipress_emerald_*')` hooks expose every editorial content array for child-theme overrides.

### 1.5.x — Atelier-ledger drawer + design-handoff polish
Atelier-ledger mobile drawer (warm cream, paper-grain texture, italic-serif categories, ±28 px circular plus/minus glyph, AI search field, 3-column utility row, "Atelier pick" featured-product card, language pills + social row in the footer bay, stagger entrance, prefers-reduced-motion fallback), drawer / scrim z-index hardening above the WordPress admin bar, mobile header switched to a `display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto` layout (hamburger / logo / actions) so the strip never wraps to two rows when JavaScript injects a fourth element, mega menu walker WPML/Polylang strip.

## 🎯 Core Modules

### 1. Elementor Kit (12 screens, ready to import)

A complete kit that activates on theme install:

- **Homepage** — hero + featured categories + editorial grid + master profile + journal teaser
- **Shop archive** — banner image + featured sub-category tiles + WC product loop
- **Single product** — gallery + summary + sticky add-to-cart bar + tabs + related rail
- **About** — story page with editorial grid + master profile + timeline
- **Master profile** — artisan / maker bio template (used for `_lwp_emerald_maker` field)
- **Journal archive + single** — blog templates with eyebrow, author meta, reading-time, tag pills
- **Contact** — form-ready page with location + hours blocks
- **404** — branded editorial fallback with search input + popular-categories rail
- **Header** — desktop mega menu + sticky bar + logo + language pill + topbar
- **Footer** — multi-column with newsletter + social + cart links + shop categories
- **Animations** — entrance / hover / parallax presets
- **Global tokens** — Playfair Display + Inter + JetBrains Mono, gold accent palette

The kit auto-syncs Elementor Site Settings to the Gold palette on activation; operators can re-import or override any screen individually.

### 2. Custom Elementor Widgets (8)

Gold ships its own widget category in the Elementor sidebar:

- **Mega Menu** — adaptive menu builder with banner head, count pills, "View all →" CTA. Renders simple dropdowns when a parent has 1–3 children, full mega panels for 4+ children or third-level nesting. Configurable per-item cardinality threshold.
- **Megabar** — sub-category strip that auto-builds from the WC product taxonomy; collapsible, scrollable on mobile.
- **Hero** — split-column hero with overlay gradient, eyebrow / headline / sub / CTA fields.
- **Editorial Grid** — magazine-style card grid for blog posts or any post type.
- **Master Profile** — artisan bio card with avatar + headline + body + CTA.
- **Timeline** — vertical milestone strip for about / story pages.
- **Info Bar** — three-column trust strip (free shipping / warranty / secure checkout) usable on any page.
- **Product Card** — Gold's product loop card (also used by the WooCommerce loop override): eyebrow category + Playfair name + italic maker line + gold serif price ladder + sale badge.

All widgets live under `Elementor → LuwiPress Emerald` and inherit theme tokens automatically.

### 3. AI Surface (LuwiPress integration)

Activates when LuwiPress core 3.1.45+ is detected — visible on every page:

- **AI search suggestions** — the search overlay queries LuwiPress for natural-language autocompletes pulled from the live catalogue, not just title-prefix matches. "Loud middle-eastern drum" finds darbukas; "starter santur for kids" surfaces the right SKUs.
- **Knowledge-Graph related rail** — single-product pages render an AI-curated "you may also like" rail driven by the LuwiPress KG (taxonomy proximity + price band + master/maker overlap), not the WC default "same category, random order" stub.
- **Static-copy enrichment** — about / journal / contact pages pull AI-generated copy from the LuwiPress AI engine via the smart content compiler; placeholders like `{site_name}`, `{primary_category}`, `{master_count}` resolve from live data on render.
- **Customer chat widget** — Gold defers the storefront chat UI to the LuwiPress core widget so the operator owns one chat experience across themes. Theme just ensures placement + responsive sizing.

### 4. Native Customizer Panel (8 sections, live preview)

`Görünüm → Özelleştir → LuwiPress Emerald` exposes:

- **Brand** — logo accent letter (the wordmark italic-gold flourish), palette tokens, typography fallbacks
- **Topbar** — location, phone, email, promo strip, track-order URL + label, language pill toggle
- **Header** — logo type (text / image), sticky toggle, topbar visibility per breakpoint
- **Mega Menu** — menu picker, threshold (when to switch from dropdown to full panel), column count preference, count badges on/off, mobile mode (drawer / accordion), blog auto-inject toggle
- **Footer** — 9 social platform URLs (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Pinterest, TikTok, X, LinkedIn, Spotify), newsletter form action URL + field name + headline + blurb, 3 trust signal lines, auto WC payment-method row toggle, "Shop" categories column toggle + item count limit (3-12)
- **Animation** — page loader on/off, scroll reveal on/off, cart bump on/off
- **Performance** — page/category slug conflict resolver toggle (with live conflict count)

Live preview reflects every change without page reload. Settings persist as theme mods (no extra DB table).

### 5. Ecosystem Dashboard

`Görünüm → LuwiPress Emerald` opens a single-page admin dashboard summarising the active integration:

- **Theme version + LuwiPress core version** side by side, with an "out of sync" warning if the core is older than 3.1.45 (theme companion contract baseline)
- **Capability matrix** — which storefront features are live based on the `luwipress_theme_companion` filter contract (AI search · KG rail · YouTube modal · sub-category tiles · master overlay · migration tool)
- **Friendly plugin pills** — green / red status per supported plugin (Elementor, WooCommerce, WPML / Polylang, Rank Math / Yoast, LiteSpeed / WP Rocket, Mailchimp / Brevo)
- **Quick links** — to Elementor Kit import, Customizer, Migration tool, LuwiPress AI settings

### 6. Slug-Conflict Resolver (5-pass discovery)

Purpose-built for the most painful WooCommerce takeover scenario: the legacy site has static page URLs (`/string-instruments/`, `/percussions/`) that should be product-category archives. Gold redirects every visitor to the canonical archive without deleting the legacy pages — they stay in the database, editable from admin, just orphaned from the live navigation flow.

Five discovery passes run in order, each catching a different shape of collision:

1. **Exact slug match** — page slug equals term slug. Catches obvious cases like `/percussions/` vs the `percussions` term.
2. **WPML / Polylang cross-language** — translated page slugs (`/es/percusiones/`, `/fr/vents/`) match against the term in *any* language via the translation table. Without this, multilingual stores miss every translated page.
3. **Plural and prefix fuzzy** — `arabic-oud` page → `arabic-ouds` term, `persian-kamancheh` page → `persian-kamancheh-kemenches` term. Single-candidate gate prevents false positives.
4. **Levenshtein-1 fuzzy** — `classical-kemence` page ↔ `classical-kemenche` term (a one-character translit nuance), `saz-baglama-accessories` page ↔ `saz-baglama-acessories` term (an operator typo). 6-character minimum + single-candidate gate keeps the safety net tight.
5. **Menu-parent inheritance** — a page with no direct term match but registered as a child menu item under a category in the menu inherits its parent's archive. So a `/santur/` editorial page sitting under "String Instruments" in the menu auto-redirects to the `string-instruments` archive.

System pages (cart, checkout, my-account, privacy, front, posts) are detected at runtime and excluded — no operator-set custom slug needs special handling.

Operator opts in via Customizer → LuwiPress Emerald → Performance. Reversible by flipping the toggle off.

### 7. WooCommerce Storefront Polish

- **Branded cart-empty page** (1.6.4) — when the cart is empty, visitors see an editorial layout with icon + headline + "Browse the collection" + "My orders" CTAs + 3-product best-seller rail. No more blank middle between header and footer.
- **Product card override** — Gold's `content-product.php` template replaces WC's default. Eyebrow category, italic maker line (pulled from `pa_master` / `pa_maker` taxonomy or `_lwp_emerald_maker` post-meta), Playfair name, gold serif price ladder, sale percentage badge top-left. Entire card is one anchor → product page (no inline buttons fighting for tap-target).
- **Loop grid normalisation** — `minmax(0, 1fr)` instead of plain `1fr` so cards don't collapse to ~70 px wide when WC ships raw `<img width="600">` markup. Responsive 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 across `1100px / 700px / 600px` breakpoints.
- **PDP sticky add-to-cart bar** — fades in when the native cart button scrolls off, fades back out when the footer enters view (IntersectionObserver handoff).
- **Sale badge** — small mono-font percentage chip, accent-red, top-left of every card on sale.
- **Cart drawer** — slide-in panel from the right; auto-opens after `added_to_cart` jQuery event, content driven by the live `woocommerce_mini_cart()` fragment so quantity / removal updates over AJAX without page reload.
- **My-account polish** — orders pill statuses, address card grid, account-stat tiles (orders count, lifetime spend, saved addresses).
- **Account popover** — header account icon opens a smart panel: logged-out users get a quick-login form + "Why sign in" perks; logged-in users get greeting + dashboard / orders / addresses / sign-out links. No native WC `[woocommerce_my_account]` redirect needed.
- **Smart filter sidebar** (1.6.3) — auto-discovers WC attribute taxonomies (every `pa_*` your store has registered) and renders them as native WC layered nav widgets, plus price filter + tag cloud + on-sale / in-stock toggles. Replaces the redundant Categories list (already in the mega menu).
- **YouTube modal** — any link with `data-lwp-yt="VIDEO_ID"` opens an in-page modal lightbox instead of redirecting to youtube.com. Esc closes; modal is fully accessible.
- **Pagination → Gold** — circular pills with mono-font numerals, active pill in dark accent.

### 8. Header (no theme builder needed)

When Elementor Pro Theme Builder is **not** active, Gold renders a complete fallback header inline:

- **Topbar** — location / phone / email on the left; language pill + track-order link + promo strip on the right. WPML / Polylang detected automatically; falls back silently on single-language sites.
- **Sticky bar** — logo (custom logo upload OR stylised wordmark with italic-gold accent letter) + adaptive mega menu + icon buttons (search ⌕, account ◯, cart ▣ with live badge count).
- **Search overlay** — full-screen panel with AI suggestions wired in (LuwiPress 3.1.45+).
- **Mobile drawer (1.5.x)** — atelier-ledger styling with paper-grain texture, italic-serif categories, ±28 px plus/minus glyphs, AI search field, 3-column utility row, "Atelier pick" featured-product card. Z-index above WordPress admin bar; sticky headers drop to z-index 1 with `pointer-events: none` while drawer is open.
- **Mobile header layout (1.5.3)** — single-row 3-column grid: hamburger left, logo centre with `max-width: 60vw + max-height: 36px` cap, action icons right. Never wraps to two rows even when JavaScript injects a fourth element.

When Elementor Pro Theme Builder **is** active and a Header template is set, Gold yields to it — no double-rendering.

### 9. Mobile Editorial Templates (1.6.0)

Five templates rebuilt from the design handoff:

- **404.php** — editorial fallback with branded message, search input, popular-categories rail. No "Page not found" generic.
- **search.php** — sticky search bar at top + result-type tabs (Products / Masters / Journal) + image-left result rows. AJAX-ready when active filter is set via `?type=` query var.
- **page-about.php** — story-page layout with editorial grid + master profile blocks + timeline.
- **page-contact.php** — form-ready with location + hours blocks + map placeholder.
- **single-master.php** — artisan / maker profile page with cover image, bio, products by master, related masters.

12 `apply_filters('luwipress_emerald_*')` hooks expose every editorial content array for child-theme overrides — operators don't need to fork the templates to localise text.

### 10. Page Loader (real page-ready event driven)

The on-page loader overlay (1.6.4+, real-event-driven in 1.6.7) covers the viewport with the brand mark + spinning arc + progress bar until the page is genuinely ready:

1. Server-rendered into the DOM at `<body>` open — no flash-of-unstyled-content
2. Dismisses on the actual readiness chain: `window.load` → web fonts ready → above-the-fold images complete → 100 ms stabilisation tick
3. Force-reveals every below-the-fold reveal-animation element at the same instant — visitors don't scroll into invisible content
4. 5-second failsafe in the inline boot script — only fires if the JavaScript breaks entirely

Operator can disable globally via Customizer → LuwiPress Emerald → Animation → Page loader overlay.

### 11. Performance & Compatibility

- **Lean ZIP** — 379 KB total, 101 files. No bundled jQuery plugins, no heavyweight slider library — uses native CSS scroll-snap + `<details>` accordions where possible.
- **Critical CSS reset** — inlined inside `wp_head` at priority 9999 so the page paints with brand tokens before async stylesheets load.
- **Asset enqueue priority** — theme CSS at priority 9999 wins against generic plugin styles without `!important` arms races.
- **Dynamic version constant** — cache-buster query strings auto-update on every Version line bump in `style.css`. Stores never see "uploaded the new ZIP but visitors stuck on old assets".
- **LuwiPress soft-paired** — theme works on its own (Elementor + WooCommerce); LuwiPress just lights up the AI surface when present. No hard-dep activation block.
- **WPML / Polylang aware** — language switcher in topbar + drawer foot, auto-detected; works on monolingual stores too. Slug-conflict resolver, mega menu, breadcrumbs, all language-prefix-aware.
- **WooCommerce native** — uses standard hooks (`woocommerce_before_main_content`, `woocommerce_after_shop_loop`, etc.); replaces only `content-product.php`, `cart.php`, `cart-empty.php`, `form-checkout.php`, `single-product.php`, `archive-product.php`, `myaccount/*` templates. Compatible with WC plugins that hook the standard surfaces.
- **Elementor Pro template-include override** — posts carrying the `elementor_header_footer` page template (common after Hello Elementor migration) are routed through Gold's `<main>`-wrapped canvas instead of Elementor's bare bundled file.
- **Detected system-page skip list** — WordPress privacy page, WC shop / cart / checkout / my-account / terms, front and posts pages are pulled from runtime configuration, not hardcoded. Translated stores work without operator override.

### 12. Migration Wizard (first-run setup)

`Görünüm → LuwiPress Emerald → Wizard` (auto-launches on first activation):

- Detects existing theme on switch; offers to import the matching Elementor Kit screen (homepage, shop, etc.) without overwriting any post that already has Elementor data.
- Sets up the 12-JSON kit + Site Settings + global tokens in one click.
- Resolves slug conflicts inline (no separate Migration tool visit needed).
- Skippable; nothing destructive runs without explicit operator confirmation.
